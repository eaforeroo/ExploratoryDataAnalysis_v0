Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning

README

I will be using the NOAA data set for this Course Project. This is a well-known data set containing climate and earth sciences datasets, NOAA-NCEI is one of the world’s largest provider of weather and climate data. Land-based, marine, model, radar, weather balloon, satellite, and paleoclimatic are just a few of the types of datasets available.

The data we will use is in a file called data.csv found in the data directory. "El Niño" (ENOS) and "La Niña" is a phenomenon in the equatorial Pacific Ocean characterized by a five consecutive 3-month running mean of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Niño 3.4 region that is above (below) the threshold of +0.5°C (-0.5°C). This standard of measure is known as the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI).

This data comes from https://psl.noaa.gov/gcos_wgsp/Timeseries/Data/nino34.long.anom.data

This code written in Python includes:

01. Brief description of the data set and a summary of its attributes

02. An initial plan for data exploration

03. Actions taken for data cleaning

04. Actions taken for feature engineering

05. Key Findings and Insights, which synthesizes the results of Exploratory Data Analysis in an insightful and actionable manne

06. Hypothesis Testing

and 07. Suggestions for next steps in analyzing this data
